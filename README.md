Data Management and Storage:
MySQL Database: MySQL is used as the backend database management system. It efficiently stores and manages data related to departments, faculty, students, courses, subjects, marks, and more.

Dynamic Web Pages:
PHP Scripts: PHP is employed to create dynamic web pages that interact with the MySQL database. It allows for seamless retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion of data based on user interactions.

User Authentication and Security:
PHP and MySQL: PHP scripts handle user authentication by verifying login credentials against stored user information in the MySQL database. Passwords are securely hashed for enhanced security.

Data Display and Interaction:
PHP and HTML: PHP is integrated with HTML to dynamically populate web pages with data from the MySQL database. It facilitates the display of department details, faculty profiles, student records, and more.

Form Handling and Validation:
PHP Form Processing: PHP is used to process form submissions from users. It validates input data, handles errors, and securely inserts or updates records in the MySQL database.

Query Execution and Result Processing:
PHP and MySQL Queries: PHP executes SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete records in the MySQL database. Query results are processed and displayed to users through web pages.

Database Connectivity:
PHP MySQL Functions: PHP provides a set of built-in functions for connecting to the MySQL database, executing queries, and managing transactions.

Dynamic Content Generation:
PHP Loops and Conditional Statements: PHP's programming capabilities enable the generation of dynamic content, such as displaying lists of departments, faculty members, students, subjects, and their respective details.
